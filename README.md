## Playing With Your Element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can preview your element at
`http://localhost:8080/components/{{component_name}}/`
